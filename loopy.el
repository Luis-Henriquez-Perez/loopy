;;; Commentary:
;; `loopy' is a macro that is used similarly to `cl-loop'.  It provides "loop
;; commands" that define a loop body and it's surrounding environment, as well
;; as exit conditions.
;;
;; For more information, see Loopyâ€™s README.org or the Info files derived from
;; that README with the command `info'.

(require 'cl-lib)

;;;; Important Variables
;; These only set in the `loopy' macro, but that might change in the future.  It
;; might be cleaner code to modify from the parsing function, after the macro
;; has already set them to nil.

(defvar loopy--flags nil
  "Symbols/flags whose presence changes the behavior of `loopy'.

NOTE: This functionality might change in the future.")

(defvar loopy--flags-setup nil
  "Alist of functions to run on presence of their respective flag.

Each item is of the form (FLAG . FLAG-FUNCTION).")


(defvar loopy--loop-name nil
  "A symbol that names the loop, appropriate for use in `cl-block'.")

(defvar loopy--with-vars nil
  "With Forms are variables explicitly created using the `with' keyword.

This is a list of ((VAR1 VAL1) (VAR2 VAL2) ...).
They are inserted into the variable declarations of a `let*' binding.
They are created by passing (with (VAR1 VAL1) (VAR2 VAL2) ...) to `loopy'.")

(defvar loopy--without-vars nil
  "A list of variables that `loopy' won't try to initialize.

`loopy' tries to initialize all variables that it uses in a
`let'-like form, but this isn't always desired.

This is used in `loopy--bound-p', and is of the form (VAR1 VAR2 ...).
There are no values in this list, only variable names.")

(defvar loopy--implicit-vars nil
  "A list of variables and their values implicitly created by loop commands.

This is a list of ((VAR1 VAL1) (VAR2 VAL2) ...).
They are inserted into the variable declarations of a `let' binding.

For example, using (list i '(1 2 3)) will create an implicit variable
containing '(1 2 3).  This makes iteration easier.")

(defvar loopy--explicit-vars nil
  "A list of variables and values explicitly named in loop commands.

This is a list of ((VAR1 VAL1) (VAR2 VAL2) ...).
They are inserted into the variable declarations of a `let' binding.

This is useful for lexically scoping variables, and for declaring
an initial value before a different value assigned in the loop.

For example, using (list i '(1 2 3)) will create an explicit variable `i'.")

(defvar loopy--explicit-generalized-vars nil
  "A list of symbols and macro expansions explicitly named in loop commands.

To create `setf'-able variables, the symbol needs to be expanded
to a form that can be treated as such.  In this case, with
`cl-symbol-macrolet'.")

(defvar loopy--before-do nil
  "A list of expressions to evaluate before the loop starts.
This is done using a `progn'.")

(defvar loopy--pre-conditions nil
  "The list of expressions that determine whether the `while' loop starts/loops.
These are fed to an `and', so all conditions must be true for the
  `while' to start/loop.")

(defvar loopy--main-body nil
  "A list of expressions to run (in order) inside the loop.
These expressions are created by parsing the loop commands passed to `loopy'.

For example, the command (list i my-list) effectively puts
\(setq i (pop my-list)) into the loop body.  Most commands require some setup,
and so don't affect only the loop body.")

(defvar loopy--latter-body nil
  "A list of expressions to run after the main loop body.
These expressions are created by parsing the loop commands passed to `loopy'.

For example, updating an indexing variable should only happen
after the variable is used.")

(defvar loopy--post-conditions nil
  "Post-conditions that could cause the loop to exit evaluating the loop body.

All expressions in the list must be true for the program to continue.
This is similar to `do-while' in other languages.")

(defvar loopy--after-do nil
  "Expressions to run (in order) after the loop successfully completes.
These run in a `progn'.")

(defvar loopy--final-do nil
  "A list of expressions always run (in order) after the loop finishes/exits.")

(defvar loopy--final-return nil
  "What the macro finally returns.  This overrides any early return value.")

(defvar loopy--implicit-return nil
  "The implicit return value of loops that use accumulation commands.")

;;;;; Variables for constructing the code

;; These variable affect how the code is expanded.
(defvar loopy--skip-used nil
  "Whether a skip/continue command is present in the loop main body.")

(defvar loopy--tagbody-exit-used nil
  "Whether a command uses a tag-body to jump to the end of the `cl-block'.")
